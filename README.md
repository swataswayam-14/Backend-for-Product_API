I have developed a robust backend for an E-Commerce website using Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, MongoDB, and JavaScript. The website allows users to register, authenticate, and browse a wide range of products. The admin can easily add, delete, and update products. The website has multiple routes for clients to view all products, get specific products by ID, and more. The database is hosted in the cloud using MongoDB Atlas.
